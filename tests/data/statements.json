Schumer and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today called on Norfolk Southern Railway to immediately work with local leaders to address these concerns, as well as share their own bridge inspection reports with the City, and comprehensively respond to the report.\nGiven potential discrepancies between the City\u2019s audit and Norfolk Southern\u2019s reports of the bridges, Schumer and Gillibrand also called on the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to also meet with the City and conduct its own federal audit and review of the bridges in question to establish a more precise and detailed picture of the rail-bridge safety concerns that must be addressed.\n\u201cAfter the City of Binghamton commissioned its own independent engineering report on the safety of Binghamton\u2019s rail bridges, which raised many concerns, Norfolk Southern has a responsibility to comprehensively respond to the report to ensure the continued safety of the community. That is why I\u2019ve personally written to both Norfolk Southern and the FRA to request they promptly meet with the City to address any and all infrastructure and safety issues in the report and ensure the safety of the greater Binghamton community,\u201d said Senator Schumer. \u201cWe cannot wait for an accident to spur action; Norfolk Southern needs to come to the table to fully address the concerns raised by the City to ensure Binghamton\u2019s rail bridges are safe over the long haul.\u201d\n\u201cThe findings from the inspection report that the City of Binghamton commissioned are deeply troubling,\u201d said Senator Gillibrand. \u201cThe structural and safety concerns raised in the report must be addressed before tragedy strikes. I am urging the Federal Railroad Administration to inspect these bridges further to bring to light any immediate safety threats, and I am demanding that Norfolk Southern Railway work with the City to fully assess the situation and make the necessary repairs immediately.\u201d\nIn the wake of the devastating train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio earlier this year, along with growing concerns from local residents, the City of Binghamton called for the inspection of 28 railroad bridges throughout the city. The result was a comprehensive 900-page report that names 15 of the city\u2019s bridges as either in severe or poor condition, most of which are owned by Norfolk Southern. Schumer and Gillibrand said that although the companies who own these bridges, such as Norfolk Southern, are regularly required to complete their own inspections, potential discrepancies between their reports and the city\u2019s report have him calling for more accountability and communication from the companies. The senators want Norfolk Southern to both meet with the city and comprehensively respond to the city\u2019s independent report in detail.\nIn addition, in a letter to the FRA, Schumer and Gillibrand urged the Federal Railroad Administration to conduct its own audit and inspection of the structural safety of the railroad bridges in question, given the clear discrepancy between the City\u2019s audit and Norfolk Southern\u2019s findings of the bridges. The senators explained that the FRA\u2019s inspection will help the city understand whether or not these visual concerns pose greater safety threats to the surrounding community. Schumer and Gillibrand also sent a letter to Norfolk Southern, calling on the company to promptly share the reports from their own separate safety inspections with the City. Additionally, the senators asked that both Norfolk Southern and the FRA meet with local city leadership to discuss both reports and act swiftly to address any concerns the community may have.\nThis builds on Schumer\u2019s direct advocacy to get answers from railroad companies and increase transparency. This past April, Schumer introduced the\nbipartisan Railway Safety Act of 2023\n, legislation to help create new rail safety protocols, hold railroads accountable for malfeasance, and increase transparency of trains carrying hazardous materials. In a letter sent last March, Schumer demanded that the companies outline the steps they are taking to improve rail safety and better communicate notifications to all levels of government to ensure a preventable tragedy like Ohio\u2019s\u00a0never happens again.\nSchumer also successfully got the CEO of Norfolk Southern to testify before Congress\n.\u00a0The senator has also written to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the\nNational Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)\nurging them to undertake safety audits of the major freight railroads operating in the country.\nSchumer has long pushed for information sharing between railroads, states, and localities to\u00a0be strengthened and improved in order to increase community safety. In 2013, he called for local emergency response officials to be notified in advance of a crude oil-carrying train coming through their community. In response, the U.S. Department of Transportation promptly issued an emergency order requiring State Emergency Response Commissions to be notified, which was subsequently made permanent for High Hazard Flammable Trains in a 2015 rule. Schumer had also secured other increased safety provisions like requiring freight carriers to equip high hazard flammable unit trains carrying crude oil or hazardous materials with Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) brakes, but\nthat rule was later repealed under the Trump administration in 2018\n. In 2013, Schumer successfully pushed the federal DOT to\nregulate dangerous crude oil carrying DOT-111 tank cars\nthat were common in Upstate NY. Schumer has also pushed for\nbetter information-sharing among railroad companies and\nlocal first\u00a0responders, who are often the first on the scene of a derailment.\u00a0Prior to Schumer\u2019s advocacy, railroads carrying crude oil on High Hazard Flammable Trains through\u00a0New York communities were not required to notify emergency response teams, but he secured a\n2014 emergency order\nby the USDOT that now requires this information to be shared.\nSchumer has continuously pushed railroads to expand these provisions\nso local government and first responders have all the information they need.\nA copy of Schumer and Gillibrand\u2019s original letter to the FRA can be found\nhere\n. A copy of the Senators\u2019 original letter to Norfolk Southern can be found\nhere\nand below:\nDear Mr. Shaw:\nWe request your attention to several railroad safety concerns in the City of Binghamton, New York, which involve a number of bridges owned and operated by your company, Norfolk Southern Railway. A recent inspection commissioned by the City of all railroad bridges located within Binghamton found an alarming number of the bridges to be in troubling condition, including potential structural or safety concerns involving several of Norfolk Southern Railroad\u2019s bridges. Similarly, it is our understanding that Norfolk Southern has conducted its own separate inspection with competing findings\u2014please share those reports with the City. In light of these reports and your responsibility to the community, we request that you meet with the City to discuss both reports and act promptly to address any concerns the community may have.\nThe City of Binghamton recently hired an independent engineering firm to survey the twenty-five bridges\u2014owned by either your railroad or the New York Susquehanna & Western Corporation\u2014found within the City. The independent inspections, which began in June 2023, were visual safety inspections focused on identifying any signs of distress \u201cthat may indicate serious safety and/or structural concerns\u201d. The visual inspections found twelve bridges owned and operated by Norfolk Southern Railroad to be in severe or poor condition indicating either a structural or safety concern that requires further investigation subsequent action by Norfolk Southern.\n[1\n]\nWhile the City has made this independent bridge safety report readily available to the public, we understand that Norfolk Southern Railway has led its own inspection, but those official findings have not yet been shared with the community. Please share your findings with City immediately and meet with local leadership to discuss the reports and talk through any concerns.\nThe findings highlighted by the City\u2019s report are troubling to me, and have led us to call on the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to conduct its own independent, federal audit and inspection of Binghamton\u2019s railroad bridges. If these visual concerns detailed in the City\u2019s report are indeed indicative of larger structural or safety issues, it is Norfolk Southern\u2019s duty to act swiftly to protect the community. We look forward to hearing how you plan to work with the City to address any matters of safety and call on you to fully cooperate with any related FRA inquiries.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter. Should you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact our offices.\n###\n[1]\nchrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.binghamton-ny.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/9704",

Schumer, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and U.S. Congressman Paul Tonko today announced a major $7,288,678 in federal funding to improve the care and upkeep of Albany\u2019s urban forest and expand youth leadership programs through the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Forest Service\u2019s Urban and Community Forestry program. The representatives said this funding was made possible thanks to the historic increases they secured in the Inflation Reduction Act, which included over $1 billion for the USDA program to help increase equitable access to trees. The lawmakers said the funding will help breathe new life into the Albany community, vastly improving the health of Albany\u2019s urban forest, while connecting youth to more leadership opportunities in the community and making a cleaner greener environment for all.\n\u201cCapital Region tree lovers, put on your work gloves, get out your shovels and get ready to dig in because over $7 million is on the way to keep our urban forest healthy and help youth make our communities cleaner and greener for all. Investing in helping green spaces in our neighborhoods grow not only improves quality of life and air quality, it helps increase property values, decrease temperatures and so much more, it is how you plant the seeds for a brighter future,\u201d said Senator Schumer. \u201cI fought hard to plant this funding in the Inflation Reduction Act so that places like Albany, Glens Falls, and other cities across Upstate New York, could have access to the funding they have long needed to breathe new life into our most underserved neighborhoods. Now a greener, healthier, and more equitable Albany can finally take root and blossom.\u201d\n\u201cExpanding access to trees and green spaces is vital to ensure New Yorkers have access to nature while combating extreme heat and improving air quality. This crucial investment will help ensure that Albany area residents have equitable access to parks and nature, where families can enjoy a greener, healthier environment. I am excited to see this funding bring new life to Albany neighborhoods and I will continue to fight so all New York communities have access to the benefits of nature and green spaces,\u201d said Senator Gillibrand.\n\u201cI was proud to join my Democratic colleagues and President Biden to advance the Inflation Reduction Act and deliver the largest climate investment in history for our communities,\u201d Congressman Tonko said. \u201cThat effort has enabled this exciting announcement and will bring numerous benefits, including spurring economic growth, combatting climate change, and improving air quality. I\u2019ll continue to seize every opportunity available to deliver powerful climate solutions that speak to the needs of the American people and create a cleaner, more resilient planet for generations to come.\u201d\nUniversity at Albany President Havid\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez said, \u201cBuilding communities that are more resilient to climate change is one of the most critical tasks facing society today, and public research universities like UAlbany have an essential role to play in this process. Through the Center for Ecosystem-based Climate Adaptation, UAlbany will team with trusted community partners to help make Albany more resilient and more sustainable by engaging and educating the next generation that will steward our city through these challenges. We are very grateful to Sens. Schumer and Gillibrand and U.S. Rep. Tonko for recognizing the importance of this work and for advocating for the funding to see it through.\u201d\nAlbany Mayor Kathy Sheehan said, \"Revitalizing and protecting our urban forest is vital to the health and quality of life of our residents, and that is why we completed an inventory of every tree in our city - a study that taught us that pruning every tree at approximately the same time will ensure they live longer and more vibrantly. With more than 20,000 street trees, pruning each tree at the same time is a very tall order however securing this grant will help us do just that. I am very grateful to our Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Congressman Tonko for helping secure this important grant funding to help us improve our urban forest for years to come.\"\nSUNY Chancellor John B. King, Jr. said, \u201cAddressing climate change is an opportunity to invest in the next generation of students and leaders, leverage groundbreaking research, and authentically support our most impacted communities. My thanks to Senate Majority Leader Schumer, Senator Gillibrand, and U.S. Representative Tonko for their efforts to help us manage the impact of climate change. SUNY is proud to deploy our collective expertise in research and social sciences to help save our planet, and I congratulate University at Albany President Havid\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez and his team, as well as their partners in the City of Albany.\u201d\nA breakdown of the funding can be found below:\nThe City of Albany will use this over $1.8 million will help support the City\u2019s efforts to undertake a citywide pruning of all 20,000 street trees at one time for the first time in its history. The City of Albany recently conducted an urban forestry analysis of every tree in the city. In the past, the city would prune trees one tree at a time, one block at a time, but would never complete the entire city - something that the study showed has harmed the health of the urban forest. One of the recommendations from the study was to prune every tree at the same time to improve the health of the urban forest as a whole. The City of Albany will match the $1.8 million dollars both monetarily and in a newly created full time employee to oversee the project.\nThe University of Albany\u2019s project will establish a Center for Ecosystem-based Climate Adaptation (CECA) to enhance the climate resilience of underserved communities in Albany and educate the next generation of local leaders. The project will focus on the development and implementation of an ecosystem-based strategy for adapting to climate change, with a particular emphasis on urban forests, community empowerment and local economic growth. Key components include an intergenerational community committee, a Youth Civilian Climate Corps, youth internships, a tree nursery, agroforestry entrepreneurship training, EarthQuest climate and environmental education game clubs, and an intergenerational think tank committed to advancing best practices in ecosystem-based adaptation. The project\u2019s lead researcher is Andrei Lapenas, professor in UAlbany\u2019s Department of Geography and Planning.\nIn addition, the City of Glens Falls will be implementing a tree management plan and hire an arborist to help develop a list of the priority needs and other specifics of the urban forest care plan.\nSchumer explained that thanks to the historic investments he was able to secure in the Inflation Reduction Act the USDA\u2019s\nUrban and Community Forestry Program Grants\n, is making more than $1 billion available to increase equitable access to trees and the benefits they provide in disadvantaged urban communities. The Inflation Reduction Act provides $1.5 billion for urban and community forestry investments that 1) increase access in disadvantaged urban communities to trees and the associated benefits they provide to human health, the environment, and the economy, 2) broaden community engagement in local urban forest planning, tree planting, and management activities; and 3) improve community and urban forest resilience to climate change, extreme heat, forest pests and diseases, and storm events through best management and maintenance practices.\n###",
